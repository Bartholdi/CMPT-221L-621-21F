# Lab 9

We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

# to deploy a new website, first I would make a new folder with the name of the website as the name. Second I would make a modules, pages and routes folder inside the main folder. Next I would add the SCSS library to add style to the website. Next I would add code and test for it to run and making sure it works. After everything runs and everything is planned out. I would look for a place to serve the website.
